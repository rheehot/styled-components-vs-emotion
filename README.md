# styled-components-vs-emotion
_Last updated by @JuanmaMenendez on October 25th, 2019_
A short doc comparing the popular CSS-in-JS libraries `styled-components` and `emotion`. For a more detailed comparison, see:

## Brief Description

### [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/)
>Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

### [`emotion`](https://emotion.sh/)
>Emotion is a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library. Building on many other CSS-in-JS libraries, it allows you to style apps quickly with string or object styles. It has predictable composition to avoid specificity issues with CSS. With source maps and labels, Emotion has a great developer experience and great performance with heavy caching in production.

### Functionality
The APIs of the two libraries have [converged over time](https://css-tricks.com/the-fragmented-but-evolving-state-of-css-in-js/). Both let you create a component with styling specified via CSS, or via object notation. (Styled Components added the latter capability [in May 2018](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/999918627997470724).)

#### `styled-components`

```javascript
// CSS syntax in tagged template literal
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`
render(<Title>Hiya!</Title>)

// Object syntax
const button = styled.button({
  fontSize: '1.5em',
  textAlign: 'center',
  color: 'palevioletred'
});
```

#### `emotion`

```javascript

// CSS syntax in tagged template literal
render(
  <h1
    className={css`
      font-size: 1.5em;
      text-align: center;
      color: palevioletred;
    `}
  >
    Hiya!
  </h1>
)

// Object syntax
const titleStyles = css({
  fontSize: '1.5em',
  textAlign: 'center',
  color: 'palevioletred'
})

render(<h1 className={titleStyles}>Hiya!</h1>)

```


## Comparison
Here's how the two libraries compare based on features and stats:

### Features - at parity

### Worthy Notes

* `emotion` is [ready](https://community.frontity.org/t/which-one-should-we-use-emotion-vs-styled-components/27/8) for [React Concurrent mode](https://dev.to/pomber/about-react-suspense-and-concurrent-mode-21aj) and it has a smaller bundle size
- `emotion` [performed faster](https://github.com/A-gambit/CSS-IN-JS-Benchmarks/blob/master/RESULT.md) than `styled-components` back in March 12th when a comparison was done over all CSS-in-JS libraries. **However, maintainers of `styled-components` are actively improving performance and say [they are within 0.5-2x emotion's times](https://twitter.com/_philpl/status/1017312352641933317).**
- Kent C. Dodds recommended `emotion` over `styled-components` in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/994230853189320705) saying that it's smaller and faster.
